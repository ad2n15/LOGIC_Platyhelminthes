# LOGIC_Platyhelminthes  
scRNA-seq analysis of ligand-gated ion channel conservation (LOGIC) in schistosoma mansoni  
We explored the expression of LOGIC (n=35) identified across Platyhelminthes in scRNA-seq data of schistosoma mansoni  
scRNA-Seq data were generated by George Wendt et al (DOI: 10.1126/science.abb7709)  
Following the advice of the publisher, we used RNA assay for our analysis.  
The included files are:  

1- celltypes_cluster_res5_map_PMID_32973030.txt: A file mappes clusters to cell types
2- R code to perfor differential gene expression for each cluster against other clusters
3- python code to genearte the heat map that summarize the results in muscles and neurones
